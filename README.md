</div>

## To use this

- Install [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
- [Install the sublime package manager](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) (if it is not already installed)
- Open the sublime packages folder in a command prompt window ( browse packages )
- Clone repo into the sublime "Packages" folder
- Restart sublime and wait for the packages to be auto-installed by the sublime package manager

## Branches

- These are for different operating systems, different use cases

## Troubleshooting

- If you get a weird coloured bar across the top the screen on install of this repo, change the theme and then change it back.
  - Open the menu preferences > theme
  - Change the theme to Default.sublime-theme
  - Wait
  - Change the theme to Seti.sublime-theme
  - If that still does not fix it, try removing Seti UI theme and reinstalling it.

## Highlights / features

- Dark theme with icons.
- Autosave files.
- Code formatters using prettier library.
- Code linting for JavaScript, Python, Sass, HTML, etc.
- Case convert for easy changing case of text. (can be used with multi-select)
- If you are not already using, I recommend the use of:
  - [Ctrl-D](https://docs.sublimetext.io/guide/usage/editing.html)
    - for selecting the whole variable word and multiple instances of word in the code file.
  - [Ctrl-L](https://docs.sublimetext.io/guide/usage/editing.html)
    - for selecting multiple lines and doing things with the lines.
      - e.g. bulk modify multiple lines of code at once.
